# Rosetta Code and Maxima

A repository about Maxima in Rosetta Code.

Also Common Lisp code is available since it can be handle in Maxima sessions.

The way in which the code is handle here is different from the one of Acmeism, and we want to put the code in actual Maxima sessions with actual wxMaxima file extensions.
